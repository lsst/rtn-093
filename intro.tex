\section{Introduction}

On October 255, 2025 the Rubin Observatory was declared substantially complete having passed its Construction Completeness Review \#3 (CCR3) and ready for operations having passed its Operations Readiness Review \#2 (ORR2).  At the time of handover the construction team demonstrated the overall Rubin Observatory system is {\it capable} of meeting its required science driven technical performance as articulated in the Science Requirements Document \cite{LPM-17}, LSST System Requirements \cite{LSE-29} and Observatory System Specifications \cite{LSE-30} documents. 

The LSST strategy and it's associated cadence in the 10--year period (currently allowing for modest assumed degradation in year 1) are detailed by the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee \cite[SCOC,][]{PSTN-056}. In this technote, we define the set of key performance criteria that the Operations team, in consultation with operations partners SLAC and NOIRLab, the post-handover Construction team, the Rubin Management Board, funding agencies, and the science advisory committee will use to guide the decision to begin the LSST.
