\section{Introduction}

Rubin Observatory will be substantially completed by October 2025. In practice this means the Operations team \cite[see][]{RDO-018} will assume responsibility of the Observatory and regular operations: running the facility on Cerro Pach\'{o}n each night, transferring data over the long haul network to the USDF, processing and arching the data, etc. 

Depending on the reliability of the overall system at the time of handover, it may be necessary to improve processes or sub-system reliability in advance of formally beginning the execution of the the 10 year Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The survey strategy and it's associated cadence in the 10 year period (currently allowing for modest assumed degradation in year 1) are detailed by the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee \cite[SCOC,][]{PSTN-056}. 

In this technote, we define the criteria that the Operations team, in consultation with operations partners, the post-handover Construction team, the Rubin Management Board, funding agencies, and the science advisory committee, will use to guide the decision to begin the LSST. 

The LSST will begin after the handover to Operations. The handover will happen on October 25th, 2025. Formal transition of construction to staff into Operations from SLAC commissioning and AURA (into NOIRLab) will be on October 1, 2025. See section~\ref{secSched} below for the current schedule.
