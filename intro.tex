\section{Introduction}

Rubin Observatory will be completed in 2025, perhaps as early as September. In practice this means the Operations team \cite[see][]{RDO-018} will assume responsibility of the Observatory and regular operations: running the facility on Cerro Pach\'{o}n each night, transferring data over teh long haul network to the USDF, processing and arching the data, etc. 

Depending on the reliability of the overall system at the time of handover, it may be necessary to improve processes or sub-system reliability in advance of formally beginning the execution of the the 10 year Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The survey strategy and it's associated cadence in the 10 year period (allowing for modest assumed degredation in year 1) are detailed by the SCOC \cite[]{PSTN-056}. 

In this technote, we define the criteria that the Operations team, in consultation with operations partners, the Rubin Managment Board, funding agencies, and the science advisory committee, will use to guide the decision to begin the LSST. 

The LSST will begin after the handover to Operations. Currently this is forecast for the end of FY25. Formal transition of construction to staff into Operations from SLAC commissioning and AURA (into NOIRLab) will be on October 1, 2025. All construction can currently charge aligned activities to operations.
