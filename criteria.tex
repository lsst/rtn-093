\section{Criteria to begin the LSST}

Armed with an understand of the system performance as outlined above and the Operations team readiness, we will use a set of objective criteria to gate the start of the LSST. These criteria will be concise and easily understandable so that the community of scientists and stakeholders counting on Rubin and the survey will have confidence the Observatory is on track.

The criteria we will use that are listed below are only to start the survey. There may be key processes within the overall system, including data management and processing that require further work after handover (beyong the construction project requirements), but unless they would prevent delaying the syrvey start, they are not discussed or enumerated here.

The Operations team discussed an initial set of criteria with the Science Advisory Committee and community at the 2024 Rubin Community Workshop. The current criteria have been eveolved since that meeting and are shown in the table below.
